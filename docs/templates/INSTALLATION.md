  <summary>Failing Installation on WSL or Linux (missing gcc)</summary>
  When installing Homebrew on WSL or Linux, you may encounter the following error:

  ```
  ==> Installing go-service-boilerplate from go-service-boilerplate-ai/go-service-boilerplate Error: The following formula cannot be installed from a bottle and must be
  built from the source. go-service-boilerplate Install Clang or run brew install gcc.
  ```

If you install gcc as suggested, the problem will persist. Therefore, you need to install the build-essential package.
  ```
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install build-essential
  ```
