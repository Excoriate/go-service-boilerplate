## Documentation templates ðŸ“š
These documentation templates are provided as a starting point for your App documentation. It's recommended to move these files accordingly, nevertheless it's strongly encouraged to keep a concise documentation structure, keeping the `README.md` simple, concise, and store the more detailed documentation in the `docs` folder.
It includes the following files:
* `README.md` with a standard structure for a App repository.
* `RELEASE.md` file with the release instructions for your App.
* `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with the instructions for contributing to your App.
* `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file with the code of conduct for your App.
* `LICENSE.md` file with the license for your App.
>**NOTE**: It's recommended to move these files accordingly. However, normally a patter where the most detailed documentation is stored in the `docs` folder is used.
